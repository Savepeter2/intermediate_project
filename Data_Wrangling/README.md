I preprocessed a dataset of over 500,000 rows, extracting features and cleaning the data through the following major steps:

Removing duplicates
Removing empty rows
Converting columns to appropriate data types
Filtering and correcting invalid entries

Feature extraction focused primarily on the InvoiceDate (DateTime) column, yielding the following new columns:

Year
Month name
Day name
Week of the month

The dataset is now clean, and the extracted features are ready for analysis.
