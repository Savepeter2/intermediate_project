# Extracted Dates From A Text Using Regex

Created a regex pattern that extracted all the dates in this format "DD/MM/YEAR" from a text passage,
The input is a string and the output(extracted dates) is a list of all the dates. 
The compile method from the regex module("re") was utilized and the regex date pattern  "\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}" was passed to it.
