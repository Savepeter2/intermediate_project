# Extracted Dates From A Text Using Regex

I created a regex pattern that extracted all the dates in this format "DD/MM/YEAR" from a text passage,
The input is a string and the output(extracted dates) is a list of all the dates. 
I used the compile method from the regex module("re") and passed the regex date pattern "\d{2}/\d{2}/\d{4}"to it.
